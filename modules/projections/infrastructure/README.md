# projections — Infrastructure layer

Implementations of the ports: Prisma repositories, provider adapters, storage, key management.

**This is the only layer that names a vendor.** It is also the only layer containing the ORM — no Prisma type escapes it (architecture test 4).

## Import rules

May import this module's `application/` ports and `domain/`, plus frameworks. **Never another module's internals.**

_Phase 0: this directory is a skeleton. No application code exists yet._
